## Introduction

In this project, we utilize deep learning techniques to classify images into different categories. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images belonging to multiple classes. The goal is to build models that can accurately predict the class of unseen images.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `model_training.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for training various deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras.
- `model_evaluation.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to evaluating the trained models and analyzing their performance.
- `custom_visual_enhancements.py`: This Python script defines custom image preprocessing functions used for data augmentation.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Models

Several CNN architectures were explored for image classification, including:

1. **Model 1**: Basic CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
2. **Model 2**: CNN with additional convolutional and dropout layers for improved feature extraction.
3. **Model 3**: More complex CNN with batch normalization and regularization techniques.
4. **Model 4**: CNN with advanced architectural modifications and regularization to prevent overfitting.
5. **Model 5**: CNN with further enhancements and adjustments to optimize performance.

## Data Augmentation

Image data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve model generalization. Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and flipping were employed to generate augmented images.

## Training

The models were trained using the augmented image dataset. Training involved optimizing various hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks were utilized to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.

## Evaluation

The trained models were evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess their performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Confusion matrices were generated to analyze the models' classification performance across different classes.

## Results

The performance of each model was compared based on various evaluation metrics. Model 5 exhibited the highest accuracy and overall performance among the tested architectures.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models for image classification tasks. By employing CNN architectures and data augmentation techniques, we achieved competitive performance in classifying images across multiple categories.
